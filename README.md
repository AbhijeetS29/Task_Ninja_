# TaskNinja
Task Ninja is an application which allows you to manage your list of tasks that need to be done. It does adding, updating, deleting, and switching the states of each task. Just like other apps mentioned earlier, It helps you to manage tasks and projects, as well as giving you reminders about when items in your lists are due..
